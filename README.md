# Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Analysis
This dataset contains information on direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit

Goal: Analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and identify key factors that drive conversions.â€¨ðŸ“Š Skills: SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau/Power BI


ðŸ”¹ Project Scope:

* Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, standardize columns).

* Perform customer segmentation based on age, income, and previous interactions.

* Analyze which marketing channels (email, phone calls, social media) had the highest conversion rates.

* Create a dashboard in Tableau or Power BI to visualize the campaign's success.

* Provide business recommendations (e.g., focus more on specific customer segments).

## 1. Data Extraction & Loading
* Use Python (Pandas) for loading the data, especially since the dataset is available in a CSV format on the UCI repository.
    * You can easily load the data into a Pandas DataFrame for further cleaning and analysis.
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_your_dataset.csv")


SQL can be used if you are storing the data in a database or if you're working with larger datasets in a relational database.


## 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Use Python (Pandas):
    * Handle missing values (if any). Use techniques like forward filling (df.fillna()) or imputation to clean data.
    * Convert columns to the correct data types (e.g., categorical columns should be converted to category type in Pandas).
    * Standardize column names to be consistent and easy to work with.
    * Drop irrelevant columns if necessary (e.g., duration if itâ€™s highly skewed and not relevant to the analysis).
    * Create new features such as age groups or binning income to create segments.
* pythonâ€¨Copy codeâ€¨â€¨â€¨df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[18, 30, 50, 70, 100], labels=['18-30', '30-50', '50-70', '70+'])




## 3. Customer Segmentation
* Use SQL for segmentation if the data is in a database. Perform basic GROUP BY operations to categorize customers (age group, income group, etc.), which helps in understanding customer behavior in a marketing context.sqlâ€¨Copy codeâ€¨â€¨â€¨SELECT age_group, COUNT(*) AS num_customers, AVG(balance) AS avg_balance
* FROM bank_marketing
* GROUP BY age_group;
* â€¨â€¨
* Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to further segment the customers by different metrics (age, income, etc.) and visualize these segments.
    * Visualize how different segments are performing in terms of conversion rates using bar charts or histograms.
* pythonâ€¨Copy codeâ€¨â€¨â€¨import seaborn as sns
* sns.boxplot(x='age_group', y='balance', data=df)

## 4. Campaign Performance Analysis
* Use SQL to aggregate conversion rates and performance metrics for each marketing channel. This step will give you a high-level view of which marketing methods (email, phone calls, etc.) are most effective.sqlâ€¨Copy codeâ€¨â€¨â€¨SELECT contact, COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
*        SUM(CASE WHEN y = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS converted_customers,
*        (SUM(CASE WHEN y = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS conversion_rate
* FROM bank_marketing
* GROUP BY contact;
* â€¨â€¨
* Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to calculate additional performance metrics and create detailed visualizations.
    * Calculate conversion rates, ROI, and other metrics that are meaningful for the business.
    * Create bar charts or heatmaps to visualize which channels are most successful.
* pythonâ€¨Copy codeâ€¨â€¨â€¨conversion_rates = df.groupby("contact")["y"].value_counts(normalize=True).unstack() * 100
* conversion_rates.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True)

## 5. Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation
* Use Tableau/Power BI:
    * Create interactive dashboards to visualize the campaignâ€™s effectiveness. You can display:
        * Conversion rates by marketing channel.
        * Customer segmentation (e.g., age or income groups).
        * ROI and campaign performance.
    * You can also add interactivity, such as allowing the user to filter by different variables (age, income, etc.).
    * Use filters to enable users to drill down into specific segments or campaign channels.
* Key Visualizations in Tableau/Power BI:
    * Bar Charts for comparing conversion rates across channels.
    * Heatmaps for showing the relationship between age, income, and campaign conversion.
    * Pie Charts to show the distribution of successful vs. unsuccessful campaigns.
 
## 6. Business Insights & Recommendations
* Use Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn):
    * After analyzing the campaign performance, you could create a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) to predict which customers are most likely to convert, based on features like age, income, previous interactions, etc.
    * This can help the marketing team focus on high-potential customer segments.
    * Recommendation: Based on your analysis, you might recommend focusing marketing efforts on specific customer segments, such as:
        * Younger customers (18-30) who have higher conversion rates.
        * Customers with higher income who tend to have a higher ROI.
